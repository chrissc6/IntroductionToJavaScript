#Lesson 1<br/>

The vast majority of Web pages out there right now contain some JavaScript code.<br/>
JavaScript code is executed in the Web browser.<br/>
Web page = content + code<br/>
JavaScript controls how the page behaves or reacts when users click something on the page.<br/>
JavaScript is an interpretive language. (scripting language)<br/>
JavaScript was first developed for the popular Netscape Navigator Web browser. (LiveScript)<br/>
Netscape handed JavaScript over to ECMA International, a global standards organization in 1996.<br/>
The standardized language that the ECMA has created is officially named ECMAScript.<br/>

Basic syntax of JavaScript methods:<br/>
method(parameters)<br/>

JavaScript is case-sensitive<br/>

#Lesson 2<br/>

Events are things that happen while a person is viewing and interacting with the page.<br/>
The act of taking control of exactly what happens in response to some event is called event handling.<br/>
To control exactly when a piece of JavaScript code executes, we use event handlers inside HTML tags.

Code between <script> tags executes when the page first opens in the browser.<br/>
Functions are placed between <script> tags in the head section.<br/>
Each function is identified by the word function followed by a name.<br/>
Functions are executed when called by event handlers in tags.

A span is an inline element that's only as wide as the characters contained within it.

In inline JavaScript, the outermost quotation marks after the event handler should match.

Each line of code in a JavaScript can end in a line break, or a semicolon, or both.

Events:<br/>
*onmouseover
*onclick
*oncontextmenu
*ondblclick

Basic syntax of JavaScript methods:<br/>
function name(){<br/>
//code<br/>
}

Debugging JavaScript:<br/>
The browser will always try to execute your JavaScript code.<br/>
You can use console.log() to display JavaScript values in the debugger window<br/>
You can set breakpoints in the JavaScript code.
